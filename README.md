# Background on the TikTok scenario

TikTok users have the ability to submit reports that identify videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. The process generates a large number of user reports that are challenging to consider in a timely manner. 

TikTok is working on the development of a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

# Project background
TikTok’s data team is in the earliest stages of the claims classification project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

Build a dataframe for the TikTok dataset

Examine data type of each column

Gather descriptive statistics

# Goal
The goal is to construct a dataframe in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of the findings.

# Insights:

Of the 19,382 samples in this dataset, just under 50% are claims—9,608 of them.

Engagement level is strongly correlated with claim status. This should be a focus of further inquiry.

Videos with banned authors have significantly higher engagement than videos with active authors. 

Videos with authors under review fall between these two categories in terms of engagement levels.
